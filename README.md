# Part One: Using Scratch

### Introduction

To program drones with Scratch following tools are required:
- Tello Mobile App
- Scratch3-Tello

The app can be downloaded form the App- or Google-Play-Store. 
Simply scan the QR-Code below to get redirected to the store page.

The Tello Mobile App is only used to configure the drone WIFI.
Follow these steps:

- Press the Power-Button on the side of the drone (Attention: Drone remembers every press of the button. So don't spam it)
- Connect your device with the drone WIFI
- Open the Tello Mobile App, go to settings, select WIFI and configure WIFI-name and -password

[Here](https://scratch3-tello.app/) you are able to find the packages for your OS to download. These are required to use Scratch.

After unpackaging you can start the extension via the contained .exe-file.

### Simple Overview

#### Instructions

| Instructions | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| takeoff | drone takes off |
| land | drone automatically lands |
| up *x* cm | drone ascends by *x* cm |
| down *x* cm | drone descends by *x* cm |
| move left *x* cm | drone moves *x* cm to the left |
| move right *x* cm | drone moves *x* cm to the right |
| move forward *x* cm | drone moves *x* cm forward |
| move back *x* cm | drone moves *x* cm back |
| rotate *x* degrees right | drone rotates *x* degrees to the right |
| rotate *x* degrees left | drone rotates *x* degrees to the left |

#### Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| pitch | rotation around y-axis |
| roll | Rotation around the x-axis running longitudinally along the vehicle |
| yaw | rotation around y-axis |
| speed x | speed in x-direction |
| speed y | speed in y-direction |
| speed z | speed in z-direction |
| height from ground | distance between ground and drone |
| height from takeoff point | distance between y-coordinate of takeoff-point and drone |
| battery remaining | remaining battery |
| height by barometer | height measured by atmospheric pressure |
| flying time | time spent flying |
| acceleration x | acceleration in x-direction |
| acceleration y | acceleration in y-direction |
| acceleration z | acceleration in z-direction |

### Example for controlling a drone

#### Steps:

1. Connect the drone to your device before executing the .exe-file
2. Create or import your Scratch-Code
3. Start your program
